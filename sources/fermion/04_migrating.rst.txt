Migrating code based on deprecated library qat.dqs
==================================================
Module :mod:`qat.fermion` replaces :code:`qat.dqs` module. This new module provides a set
of improvement and optimization, nevertheless, existing code based on :code:`qat.dqs`
must be updated. This section explains how to adapt an existing code based on
:code:`qat.dqs` to use :mod:`qat.fermion`

 - The module is now called :mod:`qat.fermion` (replaces :code:`qat.dqs`)

 - The :code:`qchem` submodule has been renamed :mod:`~qat.fermion.chemistry`
   (:mod:`qat.fermion.chemistry`)

 - :code:`qat.dqs.fermionic_util` functions have now been included
   in :code:`qat.fermion.util`:

    *  the function :code:`exact_eigen_energies` has been deleted. Use any
       eigenvalue solver on the Hamiltonian matrix directly. You can generate the matrix using
       :meth:`~qat.fermion.hamiltonians.ElectronicStructureHamiltonian.get_matrix` method

    *  the function :code:`fermionic_hamiltonian_exponential` has been deleted. Compute the
       exponential of the matrix obtained via
       :meth:`~qat.fermion.hamiltonians.ElectronicStructureHamiltonian.get_matrix` directly

 - :code:`qat.dqs.impurity` models have been relocated in :mod:`qat.fermion.hamiltonians`

 - :code:`qat.dqs.ansatz_circuits` has been renamed :mod:`qat.fermion.circuits`

 - :code:`qat.dqs.qchem.ucc` has been renamed :mod:`qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc`:

    *  :code:`build_ucc_ansatz` has been deprecated. It has been relocated to
       :code:`qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc_deprecated`, but the method
       :func:`~qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc.construct_ucc_ansatz` in
       :mod:`qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc` should be used instead. The underlying
       lower level methods have been clarified and can be used as well

    *  The :code:`get_initial_params_and_cluster_ops` function has been split into 3 separate functions for better clarity and maintenability:

       *  :func:`~qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc.guess_init_params` to get the initial parameter
          guess computed via 2nd order Mollet-Plesset perturbation theory

       *  :func:`~qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc.get_hf_ket` to get the Hartree-Fock state

       *  :func:`~qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc.get_cluster_ops` to get the cluster operator list

 - :code:`select_excitation_operators` and :code:`get_cluster_ops` have been updated. The deprecated versions are located in :code:`qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc_deprecated`

 - :code:`get_active_space_hamiltonian` has been deprecated. It can still be found
   in :code:`qat.fermion.chemistry.ucc_deprecated`
