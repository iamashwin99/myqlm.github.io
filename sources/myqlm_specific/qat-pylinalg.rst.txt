qat.pylinalg: Python Linear-algebra simulator
====================================================

myQLM comes with one simulator which performs a unitary evolution of the
initial quantum state using the operations described in a quantum circuit. This
simulator is called "Python Linear-Algebra".

It is entirely written in Python, and is based in particular on the 
`Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ library.

The quantum state is stored as an `ndarray <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html>`_ of shape
:math:`\left(2,...,2\right)`, with one 2-valued index per qubit:

.. math::

    \vert\psi\rangle = \sum_{i_{1},\dots,i_{N}\in \{0,1\}^{N}}
    a_{i_{1} \dots i_{N}}|i_{1} \dots i_{N}\rangle


where :math:`|i_{1}\dots i_{N}\rangle` represents a computational basis state.

Quantum gates are also manipulated as ndarrays, with :math:`2\times \text{arity}`
2-valued indices. Half of the indices are **input indices** and the other half
**output indices**. 

Applying a gate consists in contracting the input indices with the indices 
corresponding to the qubits on which the gate is applied:

.. figure:: tensordot.png 

The main point of using ndarrays is that this operation can be easily written
with the `np.tensordot <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.tensordot.html>`_ 
function. See source code documentation for more details.


**miscellanous remarks about the simulator**:

 * it accepts any gate, of any arity.
 * it works with the entire amplitude vector. Any information is available.
 * it is memory and run-time exponential in the number of qubits. This implies a hard simulation limit at around 20-30 qubits, depending on your RAM.


Within myQLM, this simulator is contained in the :mod:`qat.pylinalg` module.

.. note::

    The full QLM appliance also includes ''noisy'' simulators, which take into account
    realistic, parametrable physical noise into the execution of a quantum circuit.



The :mod:`qat.pylinalg` module contains a linear-algebra-based quantum simulator.
This simulator encodes the quantum amplitudes in a vector with :math:`2^n`
complex numbers, where :math:`n` is the number of qubits. This vector is modified
by the application of quantum gates.

Quantum Processing Unit
-----------------------
This is the high-level class wrapping the simulator. It follows the convention
of the :class:`qat.core.qpu.QPUHandler` structure.

.. autoclass:: qat.pylinalg.PyLinalg
    :members: serve, submit_job, submit

.. note:: The :func:`~qat.pylinalg.PyLinalg.submit_job` method above basically consists of two
   imbricated if statements.

   The first one looks at the :code:`type` attribute of the job, which can take
   two values:
    
    - :code:`OBSERVABLE` (cf. :class:`~qat.comm.shared.ttypes.ProcessingType`): the job consists in evaluating an observable at
      the end of the circuit. Currently, the attribute **nbshots** has no effect if the **type** is :code:`OBSERVABLE`
    - :code:`SAMPLING` (cf. :class:`~qat.comm.shared.ttypes.ProcessingType`): the job consists in sampling the output probability
      distribution of the quantum circuit. This is where the second if loop comes in, depending on the **number of shots** which is asked (:code:`job.nbshots`):
          
        - if **nbshots=0** then the simulator/quantum-processor returns *the best it can do*. In our case, of a linear-algebra-based simulator, this is the entire probability distribution.
           
        - else, the simulator samples the output probability distribution *nbshots* times.

Simulator Internal Functions
----------------------------

The actual numpy-based simulation code can be accessed in the :mod:`qat.pylinalg.simulator`
module, whose source code is documented here.



.. autofunction:: qat.pylinalg.simulator.simulate

.. note:: :func:`qat.pylinalg.simulator.simulate` mainly consists in a for loop
    over the :code:`ops` attribute of the input :class:`~qat.core.Circuit`,
    i.e the gates of the circuit. They are successively applied onto the quantum 
    state, which starts in :math:`|0...0\rangle`. A gate can be of several types:

     - **GATETYPE** (default)
     - **MEASURE** (measure some qubits, store the result)
     - **RESET** (measure a qubit, if result is 1, apply X onto it)
     - **CLASSIC** (perform classical logical computation on classical bits)
     - **CLASSICCTRL** (perform classically controlled quantum gate)
     - **BREAK** (raise break exception if a clasical formula is evaluated to True)

    :code:`circuit.ops` is a list of :class:`qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.Op`.
