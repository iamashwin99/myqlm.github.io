Please read the :ref:`Atos myQLM End-User Licence Agreement (Atos myQLM EULA) <license>`
carefully before using myQLM. You are only permitted to use myQLM pursuant to the terms
and conditions of this agreement. This agreement is between you and
(as an individual or legal entity) and Bull SAS.

By downloading of installing myQLM or otherwise rendering it available for your use,

Prerequisites
-------------
This version of myQLM works for Windows (with **Python 3.6**, **Python 3.7** or
**Python 3.8** 64-bit version), for MacOS (with **Python 3.6**, **Python 3.7** or
**Python 3.8** 64-bit version) and for Linux (with **Python 3.6** or
**Python 3.8** 64-bit version).

myQLM is installed using the *Package Installer for Python* (or pip). If the pip
command is not installed on your machine, you can
`download pip here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_.

myQLM comes with interactive tutorials (or notebooks). These tutorials require
Jupyter. In order to install Jupyter, please type the following command:

.. code-block::

    pip install jupyter

Moreover, if you want to display myQLM quantum circuits inside Jupyter notebooks, please
install `ImageMagick for wand. <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.4.1/guide/install.html>`_

Install
-------

Install myQLM wheels
********************
Please install myQLM by typing the following command in a Windows or Linux prompt:

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm

.. _install-magics:

Install myQLM magics
********************
myQLM provides tools to display quantum circuits inside Jupyter notebooks. These
magics can be installed using the following command:

.. code-block::

    python -m qat.magics.install

Download Jupyter notebooks
**************************
myQLM comes with interactive tutorials you can open with Jupyter Notebook. Please
download :ref:`myQLM notebooks here <myqlm-notebooks>`
and start the notebook :code:`overview.ipynb`, this notebook contains a table of
content of all our tutorials.


.. _install-interop:

Interoperability
****************
This package enables access to other quantum programming environments such as
Qiskit, projectQ, pyQuil, Cirq ...
This package will not automatically install dependency packages because someone who
want to interface with Qiskit may not want to interface with Cirq... The desired
quantum environment can be cherry-picked using the pip command:

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[<PACKAGE>_binder]

For Qiskit
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[qiskit_binder]

For ProjectQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[projectq_binder]

For Cirq
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[cirq_binder]

For PyQuil
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[pyquil_binder]

For all of them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[all]
