Prerequisites
-------------

myQLM is installed using the *Package Installer for Python* (or pip). Please ensure pip command
is installed on your machine (if not, you can `download pip here <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_)
and that myQLM is installable on your computer (by looking at the compatibility matrix below)

Compatibility Matrix

Install Jupyter
***************
myQLM comes with interactive tutorials (or notebooks). These tutorials require
Jupyter. In order to install Jupyter, please type the following command:

.. code-block::

    pip install jupyter

Moreover, if you want to display myQLM quantum circuits inside Jupyter notebooks, please
install `ImageMagick for wand. <http://docs.wand-py.org/en/0.6.6/guide/install.html>`_

Install
-------

Install myQLM wheels
********************
Please install myQLM by typing the following command in a Windows, MacOS or Linux prompt:

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm

.. _install-magics:

Install myQLM magics
********************
myQLM provides tools to display quantum circuits inside Jupyter notebooks. These
magics can be installed using the following command:

.. code-block::

    python -m qat.magics.install

Download Jupyter notebooks
**************************
myQLM comes with interactive tutorials you can open with Jupyter Notebook. Please
download :ref:`myQLM notebooks here <myqlm-notebooks>`
and start the notebook :code:`overview.ipynb`, this notebook contains a table of
content of all our tutorials.


.. _install-interop:

Interoperability
****************
This package enables access to other quantum programming environments such as
Qiskit, projectQ, pyQuil, Cirq ...
This package will not automatically install dependency packages because someone who
want to interface with Qiskit may not want to interface with Cirq... The desired
quantum environment can be cherry-picked using the pip command:

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[<PACKAGE>_binder]

For Qiskit
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[qiskit_binder]

For ProjectQ
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[projectq_binder]

For Cirq
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[cirq_binder]

For PyQuil (deprecated for python 3.6)
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[pyquil_binder]

For all of them
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

    pip install myqlm-interop[all]
