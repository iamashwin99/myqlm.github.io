qat.simulated_annealing: Simulated Annealing 
====================================================

myQLM is equipped with a simulated annealer (:ref:`SA <sa_description>`), which can solve
combinatorial problems encoded in an :ref:`Ising <ising_description>` or Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (:ref:`QUBO <qubo_description>`) formalism.

.. note::

    The full QLM appliance includes the even more powerful Simulated Quantum Annealing solver
    which has been tested on a variety of benchmarks for the
    :ref:`NP problems <np_problems_formulation>` supported. The quality
    of the solutions is :math:`> 98 \%` - see
    :ref:`SQA benchmarking and performance <benchmarking>` for more details.

Below we present the class :class:`~qat.simulated_annealing.SimulatedAnnealing` along with some
helper functions. Albeit not quantum, the simulated annealing solver is wrapped with a Quantum
Processing Unit (QPU) interface which is made to resemble the rest of the QPUs in the QLM.
It therefore consists of an implementation of the
:func:`~qat.simulated_annealing.SimulatedAnnealing.submit_job` method, which receives a
:class:`~qat.core.Job` and returns a :class:`~qat.core.Result`.
The way a job is produced is by creating a schedule for the annealing - this is temperature and
time steps during the simulation. The classes :class:`~qat.opt.Ising` and :class:`~qat.opt.QUBO`,
along with classes for the supported NP problems in :ref:`qat-opt <np_hard_problems_code>` have
implemented the :func:`~qat.opt.Ising.to_job()` method, which makes this possible.
