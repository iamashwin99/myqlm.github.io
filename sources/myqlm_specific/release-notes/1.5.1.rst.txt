Released December 6, 2021

New features
************
 - :class:`~qat.pylinalg.PyLinalg` now supports efficient implementation of controlled gates. It now supports simulation of circuits generated with the :code:`submatrices_only` keyword argument set to :code:`True` (:code:`prog.to_circ(submatrices_only=True)`)
 - :class:`~qat.core.HardwareSpecs` objects now have an attribute :code:`processing_types` used to define the type of supported measurement (e.g., Observable or Sample). QuameleonPlugin has been updated to check this new attribute 
 - Added a device 'ZUCHONGZHI' describing the Chinese quantum chip of the same name

Updated features
****************
 - :class:`~qat.pylinalg.PyLinalg` should now throw a cleaner exception (:class:`~qat.comm.exceptions.ttypes.QPUException`) when failing to retrieve the matrix of a gate
 - The :code:`get_variables` methods of myQLM objects will now return a sorted list instead of a set 
 - :class:`~qat.core.BatchResult` returned by a :class:`~qat.plugins.Junction` has the same meta_data as the input :class:`~qat.core.Batch` 

Fixes
*****
 - Fix :class:`~qat.plugins.Junction` plugins when a Batch object having no meta data is submitted
 - Fix :code:`len(Result)` when the result is stored as a map
 - An exception is now raised when trying to differentiate non-observable job
