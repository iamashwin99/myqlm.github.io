Deprecation warnings
********************
You may see these warnings when displaying a circuit:

.. code-block::

    DeprecationWarning: LAYOUT_BASIC is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 10 (2023-07-01). Use Layout.BASIC instead.
    DeprecationWarning: getsize is deprecated and will be removed in Pillow 10 (2023-07-01). Use getbbox or getlength instead.
    ...

| These warnings can be suppressed by adding a nowarning.py file under:

.. code-block::

    # The .ipython directory below maybe different if IPYTHON_DIR is defined
    $HOME/.ipython/profile_default/startup/nowarning.py

| The content of the file should be something like:

.. code-block::

    import warnings
    warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)
    warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)

Restart Jupyter
