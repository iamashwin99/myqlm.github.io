qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.Op
============================

The main 'body' of a :class:`~qat.core.Circuit` is described as a list of operations -
:class:`~qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.Op`.

.. autoclass:: qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.Op

More precisely the field `.type` in :class:`~qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.Op` can be:

.. program-output:: python3 -c "from qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes import OpType;print(list(dir(OpType))[:7])"

Once the type is set, various attributes of the :class:`~qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.Op` object
are used to store relevant pieces of information.

- **GATETYPE** corresponds to a quantum gate application (without classical control). In that case:

    - `op.gate` will contain the name of the gate (see below the gate dictionary section for
      detailed use of this name)
    - `op.qbits` will contain the list of the target qubits

- **CLASSICCTRL** corresponds to a quantum gate application with classical control.
  In addition to the fields used in the **GATETYPE** case, here we also have:

    - `op.cbits` will contain a list of size 1 with a single cbit to be used as control classical
      bit

- **MEASURE** corresponds to a measure operation:

 - `op.qbits` will contain a list of qubits to measure
 - `op.cbits` will contain a list of cbits to store the results. The two lists will have the
   exact same size.

- **BREAK** corresponds to a break operation:

    - `op.formula` will contain a (prefix formatted) string containing a boolean formula to
      evaluate over the current values of the cbits in order to determine if the computation should
      be aborted or not. :func:`qat.core.formula_eval.evaluate` provides an implementation of
      this evaluation, if required.

    .. run-block:: python

        from qat.core.formula_eval import evaluate

        formula = "AND 1 OR 0 2"
        cbit_values = [True, False, True]
        evaluate(formula, cbit_values) #should return False

- **RESET** corresponds to reset operations.

    - `op.qbits` will contain a list of qubits to reset
    - `op.cbits` will contain a list of cbits to reset

- **REMAP** corresponds to classical remaps/rewiring of the qubits. These can be seen as
  permutations of the index of the qubits.

    - `op.qbits` will contain a list of qubits that are to be rewired
    - `op.remap` will contain a list of integers describing the way the qubits are remapped

- **CLASSIC** corresponds to a classical operation between cbits.

    - `op.cbits` will contain the cbit receiving a new value
    - `op.formula` will contain a (prefix formatted) string containing a boolean formula to
      evaluate over the current values of the cbits

All quantum gates names (the `op.gate` field) are in fact keys of a dictionary stored in the
`circuit.gateDic` field of the circuit.

Entries in this dictionary are of the type :class:`~qat.comm.datamodel.ttypes.GateDefinition`.
