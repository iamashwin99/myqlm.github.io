qat.qpus.CLinalg
================

For a general description of linear-algebra-based simulators, please refer to the
:ref:`PyLinalg documentation page<reference_qat_qpus_pylinalg>`.

High-level Quantum Processing Unit
----------------------------------

.. autoclass:: qat.qpus.CLinalg
    :members: submit

This high-level class wrapping the simulator follows the convention
of the :class:`qat.qpus.QPUHandler` structure.


C++ Low-level Statevector
-------------------------

Though not the standard or recommended way of using :class:`qat.qpus.CLinalg`, the C++ statevector
object underneath this QPU can be accessed throught the *statevector* parameter, for instance:

.. run-block:: python

    from qat.clinalg import CLinalg
    qpu = CLinalg()
    # change number of qubits to 2
    qpu.statevector.resize(2)
    # reset the state to |00> and print the state
    qpu.statevector.reset()
    qpu.statevector.print()


.. warning::

    Do consider that the bit convention used in this lower-level statevector is reversed compared
    to the more intuitive one supported by the QPU interface.
    Intuitively, you will consider a state :math:`|i_0i_1i_2i_3\rangle` (with qubit 0 being the
    most significant bit); however the ordering used by the low-level statevector instance
    :math:`|i_3i_2i_1i_0\rangle` (with qubit 0 being the least significant bit).
    This influences the statevector methods *print*, *reset* (if a value is provided) and the way
    in which the statevector is interacted with through the *array* property.
