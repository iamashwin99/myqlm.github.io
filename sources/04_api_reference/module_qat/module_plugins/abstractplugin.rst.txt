qat.plugins.AbstractPlugin
==========================

.. autoclass:: qat.plugins.AbstractPlugin
    :members: compile, do_post_processing, serve

    .. method:: post_process(batch_result)

        A plugin can **optionally** post-process a result. Post-processing consists of editing
        the :class:`~qat.core.BatchResult` object returned by the QPU

        .. note::

            If your plugin does not require prost-processing, not defining this method would lead to
            better performances

        :param BatchResult batch_result: object to be post-processed
        :return: post-processed :class:`~qat.core.BatchResult`
        :rtype: :class:`~qat.core.BatchResult`
