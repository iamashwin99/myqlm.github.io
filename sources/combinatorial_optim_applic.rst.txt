Combinatorial optimization
==========================

As we hinted in the :ref:`Annealing programming <annealing_programming>` section, many problems with actual practical applications are combinatorial and can be represented as minimization or maximization ones. Here we will use the :ref:`quantum formulations <annealing_programming>` of such problems to encode and solve some of the most famous :ref:`NP-hard problems <np_problems_annealing>`.

However, it is not only annealing that allows us to encode and tackle such minimization or maximization problems. In fact, one can also use the
:ref:`gate-based <circuit>` and :ref:`analog computing <schedules_section>` approaches to create custom circuits or custom schedules, which, when
executed, should also give us the desired lowest energy, hence best answer. |product| provides:

 - Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (:ref:`QAOA <qaoa>`) relying on gate-based computation
 - Adiabatic Quantum Optimization (:ref:`AQO <aqo_sec>`) relying on analog computation
 - Adiabatic Quantum Optimization for Rydberg quantum devices (:ref:`RYD <crossing-lattice>`), relying on the Crossing Lattice
   embedding technique to target Rydberg atom devices

Since using all the three quantum computation paradigmes above leads to solving the same general task, the NP-hard problems representations were abstracted to allow a seamless shift in generating such gate-based, analog or annealing problems - the so-called *NP-hard problems generators*.
