    Welcome to the myQLM documentation
    ==================================

    `myQLM <https://atos.net/en/lp/myqlm>`_ is a quantum software stack for writing, simulating, optimizing, and executing quantum
    programs. Through a Python interface, it provides

    - **powerful semantics** for :ref:`manipulating <programming>` quantum circuits,
      with support for universal as well as custom gate sets,
      abstract parameters, advanced linking options, etc.;

    - **a versatile execution stack** for :ref:`running quantum jobs <simulating>`, including an easy handling
      of observables, special plugins for carrying out NISQ-oriented :ref:`variational methods <variational>`
      (such as VQE, QAOA), and easy API for :ref:`writing customized plugins <manipulating>` (e.g for compilation or error mitigation),
      as well as for connecting to any Quantum Processing Unit (QPU);

    - **a seamless interface** to :ref:`available quantum processors and major quantum programming frameworks <interop>`.
