myQLM Installation on MacOS
---------------------------
There are two methods supported to install myQLM on MacOS.

.. warning::

    Do not install Python 3 twice using both methods. Only follow one method or the other and install Python 3 once.
    Installing two Python 3 from different sources may have consequential behaviors (e.g. segmentation fault).

.. dropdown::  myQLM Installation on MacOS using Homebrew

    | Install Homebrew with the following command (requires sudo access, code taken from `https://brew.sh <https://brew.sh>`_):

    .. code-block::

        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

    | At the end of installation, it will ask to put Homebrew in the PATH.
    | Run the commands specified on-screen.
    | Example:

    .. code-block::

        # If default terminal is bash,  SHELL_PROFILE=".bash_profile"
        # If default terminal is zsh,   SHELL_PROFILE=".zprofile"

        echo '# Set PATH, MANPATH, etc., for Homebrew.' >> /Users/johnsmith/$SHELL_PROFILE
        echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/johnsmith/$SHELL_PROFILE
        eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

    | These commands are necessary to setup Homebrew to be used.
    | Verify Homebrew is available with the command:

    .. code-block::

        brew

    | Next is to install Python 3 using brew.
    | Install the latest Python 3 with the following command:

    .. code-block::

        brew install python3

    | You can specify the version of Python 3 by using '@' before the version number and after 'python':

    .. code-block::

        brew install python@3.9

    | Refer to the :ref:`Compatibility Matrix <install-matrix>` for supported Python versions.

    | **Information regarding Python 3 Anaconda running along Python 3 Homebrew**
    
    | Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get both Pythons working at the same time.
    | For Anaconda users, after installing Homebrew, Homebrew will become the default.
    | To reverse this change, comment out the following line in your .bash_profile OR .zprofile:

    .. code-block::

        eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

    | Log off and log back in.

    | Make sure you are using `Homebrew <https://brew.sh>`_ Python 3 [1]_ before proceeding to :ref:`myQLM Installation <install>`.

    .. [1] > which python3

.. dropdown:: myQLM Installation on MacOS using Python.org

    | Go to `https://python.org/download <https://python.org/download>`_.
    | Download the latest Python 3 and follow through the installation setup (requires sudo access).
    | After installation is complete, open a Terminal.

    **Information regarding Python 3 Anaconda running along Python 3 from Python.org**

    | Unfortunately, there is no easy way to get both Pythons working at the same time.
    | For Anaconda users, after installing Python 3 from python.org, python.org will become the default.
    | To reverse this change, comment out the following line in your .bash_profile OR .zprofile:

    .. code-block::

        PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.8/bin:${PATH}"

    | Log off and log back in.

    | Make sure you are using Python 3 [2]_ from `python.org <https://python.org/>`_ before proceeding to :ref:`myQLM Installation <install>`.

    .. [2] > which python3
