            .. tab-item:: Running notebooks using myBinder

                myQLM notebooks can be executed without installing anything, by running these notebooks in your web
                browser, using myBinder. Several environments are available:

                .. card:: myBinder without myQLM-interop
                    :link: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/myQLM/myqlm-notebooks/master?filepath=overview.ipynb

                    Run myQLM notebooks in your browser, using an environment without myQLM-interop installed.
