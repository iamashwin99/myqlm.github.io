CLinalg: C++ Linear-algebra-based simulator
-------------------------------------------

Proposed as a faster alternative to :class:`~qat.qpus.PyLinalg`, :class:`~qat.qpus.CLinalg` is a
Linear-algebra simulator written in C++, with a python (pybind11) interface.

It is the default simulator of myQLM.

For a general description of linear-algebra-based simulators, please refer to the
:ref:`PyLinalg documentation page<reference_qat_qpus_pylinalg>`.

**miscellanous remarks about the simulator**:

 * it accepts any gate, of any arity.
 * it works with the entire amplitude vector. Any information is available.
 * it is memory and run-time exponential in the number of qubits. This implies a hard simulation limit at around 20-30 qubits, depending on your RAM.
