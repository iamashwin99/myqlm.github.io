PyLinalg: Python Linear-algebra-based simulator
-----------------------------------------------

:class:`qat.qpus.PyLinalg` was the first simulator delivered with myQLM.
It performs a unitary evolution of the initial quantum state using the operations described in a
quantum circuit. This simulator is called "Python Linear-Algebra".

It is entirely written in Python, and is based in particular on the
`Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ library.
